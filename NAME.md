# Name

> Hi! Please make me suggestions for a app name. The app makes it possible to search for books, by title or isbn number. The use case is to scan the book isbn code via mobile phone, share it to the app. And the app is then showing information of the book, like author, title, a cover image etc. This information then can be shared with friends or a note app
